#Description

snekTrakr is a hybrid-mobile application built for streamlining the access and updating  records on a snake breeder/hobbyist's animals. It was built using the Ionic framework utilizing Angular 1 on the front end. The back-end is built with Node/Express/Postgres and is deployed on Heroku. The interface is designed and displayed in a card style system for ease of use. The app is available for free on the google play store for Android devices running 4.0.3 and up.

This is the repo for the application (front-end).
